Wow, it has been QUITE a while, hasn't it?

Recently lost my computer a while back and had to do with a school chromebook I have, it's all I have to work with, but I eventually did manage to get github on here. I wasn't able to get VSCode working entirely on here, so I had to use replit. It still worked out though. Anyway, I kind of quit HTML and I'm working on python now. 

This is a really basic project, but I hope to add to it once I learn more python

by all means do whatever with the code, I  genuinly do not care

if you somehow make money from this then good for you, doesn't matter if you give it to me or not

anyway I'll be trying my best to upload more on here, cya.
