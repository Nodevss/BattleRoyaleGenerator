# Version 1.0 | Hiya.
Wow, it has been QUITE a while, hasn't it?

Recently lost my computer a while back and had to do with a school chromebook I have, it's all I have to work with, but I eventually did manage to get github on here. I wasn't able to get VSCode working entirely on here, so I had to use replit. It still worked out though. Anyway, I kind of quit HTML and I'm working on python now. 

This is a really basic project, but I hope to add to it once I learn more python

by all means do whatever with the code, I  genuinly do not care

if you somehow make money from this then good for you, doesn't matter if you give it to me or not

anyway I'll be trying my best to upload more on here, cya.

# Version 2.0.1 | Redid the entire system lol 
Hey again, did some work and improved this entire thing. For starters, I added more usernames [JOJO REFERENCES!!!] using AI. <sup><sub>I swear that's the only thing I used AI for</sub></sup> as well as improving the combat system so you could see remaining players, health, and see who shot who so it's more realistic and slow paced rather than just seeing kills. I also added an elimination counter so a bot can flex their kills!!!! I also added storm because why not. Bots can also pick up healing items and heal. I wanted to make the project much less paced so the project wouldn't look so small. I also made an inventory system but it doesn't really matter too much, might just remove it.

I'm most likely not going to work on this project anymore. I have a huge exam tommorow and cannot fail it. I haven't studied at all soooo like yeah. This project was mainly just to get the basics of python done. I've heard about tynker and I might transfer this project to there at some point if I'm able to, but other than that I won't change anything here. Gonna work on more projects.

Ok goodbye to the 0 people that have seen this project, have a good night.
